# Documentation for Publication yml
#
# type: dependent on...
#
#       direct:       Needs 'name' of field in chado database.
#       relationship: Needs 'cvterm' of the relationship.
#       pubprop:      Needs 'cvterm' of the property to add
#       ignore:       Nothing.
#                     NOTE: P1 has other values but becouse it is used in the creation of
#                           new pub or checking for existing pubs, or changing with !c
#                           additional info like cvterm etc are needed.
#       dbxref:       Needs 'dbname' of the db.
#       pubauthor:    Nothing.
#
# So a direct type gets added to the pub directly, i.e. it is the same as the field name 
# in chado and therefore aonly needs the name of that field to be able to change/add it.
#
# Relationships are stored in the pub_relationship table and need a cvterm to define how
# they are related.
#
# Dbxrefs are stored in the pub_dbxref table.
#
# Description is just in there to help out.
#
# Other terms are used to allow specific fields to do special things in the code instead
# of creating more types. 
# i.e. verify_only_on_update in P2
#      Will not add new relationship each time it is seen (only on creation of new pubs)
#      It instead is used to make sure if pub already has a parent it matches this.
